# whiteboard

Prompt:

Create HTML/JS sample code for SVG based whiteboard.

Ensure the code is really working 100% .

Environment details:
- Pure pure HTML/JS only
- Run in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari) on PC, Tablet and Mobile (Android and I-Phone)?

Exact feature list:
- open SVG
- save SVG
- save PNG (with transparent background)
- color picker
- stroke with slider
- erase specific line 
- multi-touch
- pan/zoom

Behavior expectations:

- SVG file should open standalone in a browser after download
- PNG export should have transparent background
- Board resize dynamically with the window

Performance constraints:
- It is okay to use inline JavaScript only. 
- Do not split into separate .js and .css files.

Testing target:
- Desktop 
- Mobile (iPhone and Android)
- Single-touch gestures (drawing with one finger only)
